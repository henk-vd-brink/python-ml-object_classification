## About the Project
This project contains my first machine learning project. I build a custom CNN to classify images containing a single dice. The main goal was to familiarize myself with pre-processing data, building a CNN to understand how the different layers work, and testing the resulting model for accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/henk-vd-brink/python-ml-dice_detection.git
